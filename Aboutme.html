                        <h2> My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2> 
                        <strong> I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
                         <br> <br> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship. 
                         <br> <br> <h3> How I turned things around </h3> 
                         <br> <strong> was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. 
                         It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked. 
                         <br> <h3> Now I live the simple life </h3> <br>
                         Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. <br> 
                          <br> With how much it turned my life around, <strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, </strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
